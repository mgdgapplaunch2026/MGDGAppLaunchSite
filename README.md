## 05. Protocol Logic



* **The 1:1 Rule:** The UI includes a "Live Market Dashboard" anchored to a 1:1 Physical Reserve Ratio.

* **Lead Vetting:** The onboarding form uses "Protocol-Onboarding" language to filter for wealth preservation interests.

* **Sovereign Resilience:** All design choices (`Stone-950` / `Gold-400` palette) evoke the stability of a private vault.
